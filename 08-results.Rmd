# Writing results

The results section of a scientific paper is where you present the findings of your study in a clear and concise manner, without interpretation or discussion. The goal is to communicate the outcomes of your research in a way that is both logical and visually effective.

## Key Elements of a Results Section

1.	Report Summary Data:
	- Indicate how many studies your search returned.
	- Specify how many studies were excluded and the final number of studies reviewed.
2.	Highlight Themes:
	- Identify and report the number of themes your research revealed.
3.	Figures and Visuals:
	- Include clear and relevant figures to illustrate your findings. 
	- Examples:
  	- A timeline showing the number of studies published over time.
  	- A pie chart displaying the proportion of studies addressing different themes.
  	- A map or chart showing regional classifications of papers, if applicable.
	4.	Keep it Brief:
	- The results section should focus solely on presenting data and findings. Reserve explanations or interpretations for the discussion section.

## Tips for Structuring the Results Section

This methods section will be brief, but for future assignments consider.
- Organizing results under subheadings that align with your research questions or thematic categories.

- Use Tables and Figures Effectively:
	- Ensure tables and figures are self-explanatory with clear captions.
	- Refer to figures and tables directly in the text to guide readers.
	
Focus on the Facts:
Avoid discussing the implications or significance of your findings here. This is strictly for presenting what you found.

## Example Structure

“Our systematic review retrieved 150 studies, of which 50 were excluded after screening, resulting in a final dataset of 100 studies. These studies were grouped into three themes: environmental impacts, policy responses, and community engagement. Environmental impacts were addressed in 40% of the studies, policy responses in 35%, and community engagement in 25%. Regional analysis indicated the majority of studies were conducted in North America and Europe. The majority of references were generated in the United States (Fig. 1)”

By following these steps, you can craft a results section that effectively communicates your findings while setting the stage for a compelling discussion section.
