# Working in groups

This week you will form the groups (up to 4 individuals). During the semester, you will work with your team to complete the project and presentation. You also have the option to work alone, but working in groups is a great experience! For all activities related to the project, I ask each group member to turn in an assignment - this helps me track attendance and participation.

To facilitate group work, this week you will turn in a group work communication plan (if you choose to work alone, select 'Working alone' on the plan, and turn that in). The communication plan will serve as a contract for how you will work in groups. Since you have the option to influence the final grade of your groupmates, please be sure to document and address any problems as they arise. 

Since we will work on this project during class time, attendance is expected, with exceptions in the case of illness or emergency. At the end of the semester, you will have the ability to affect the grade of your group members (see 'Peer performance review'). This peer performance review is meant to address significant problems, not slight differences in effort. To reduce a peer's grade, the peer performance document must be submitted, an attempt made to correct the problematic behavior and the complaint shared with the instructor.

For problematic group members, please follow these steps:

1. Engage the student to ask that they complete specific tasks on a timeline. 
2. Then, if issues continue, please contact your instructor, providing an explanation of the problem.
3. Finally, if the issue persists, you can ask the group member to leave the project.

Today, please fill out the communication plan and review the peer performance review document.
