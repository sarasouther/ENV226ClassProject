# Working in groups

This week you will form the groups (up to 4 individuals) that you will work in during the semester. You also have the option to work alone, but working in groups is a great experience! To facilitate group work, this week you will turn in a group work communication plan (if you choose to work alone, select 'Working alone' on the plan, and turn that in). This will serve as a contract for how you will work in groups. 

Since we will work on this project during class time, attendance is expected, with exceptions in the case of illness or emergency. At the end of the semester, you will have the ability to affect the grade of your group members (see 'Peer performance review'). This peer performance review is meant to address significant problems, not slight differences in effort. To reduce a peer's grade, the peer performance document must be submitted, an attempt made to correct the problematic behavior and the complaint shared with the instructor.
