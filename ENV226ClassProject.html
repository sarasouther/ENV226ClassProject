<p>During the semester, we will explore an ecological theme of interest to you. This project will walk you through several critical aspects of conducting scientific research, including searching scientific databases, evaluating informational quality, analyzing literature, summarizing information, and writing-up your process and findings in a scientifically rigorous manner. In this way, this project addresses the course’s student learning objectives (below) and builds several core competencies required for a career in the sciences or other fields.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Student Learning Objectives<a href="#student-learning-objectives" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Apply the scientific method, identify and interpret scientific literature.</p>
<p>Competencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Career &amp; Self-Development</strong>: Proactively develop oneself and one’s career through continual personal and professional learning, awareness of one’s strengths and weaknesses, navigation of career opportunities, and networking to build relationships within and without one’s organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professionalism</strong>: Knowing work environments differ greatly, understand and demonstrate effective work habits, and act in the interest of the larger community and workplace.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teamwork</strong>: Build and maintain collaborative relationships to work effectively toward common goals, while appreciating diverse viewpoints and shared responsibilities.</p></li>

<p>Working alone or in groups of up to 4, you will perform a literature review of an ecological topic of your choosing. You will present your work both in the form of a manuscript and a presentation. There are different forms of literature reviews - we will be going further than the literature reviews typically performed for a lab report or other class project. Instead, we will perform a <em>systematic</em> literature review. A systematic literature review is similar to conducting research in the lab, except instead of collecting data on living organisms, you will collect data on a body of literature.</p>
<p>To do this, you will first select a question of interest. Your questions may address any topic in ecology - examining how organisms relate to one another and to their environment. The only qualifier is that there must be enough literature published on the topic to generate novel insights, by examining and summarizing the literature.</p>
<p>As an <strong>example</strong>, here are some questions from previous years:
- How will climate change affect Pinyon species in the Southwest?
- What factors lead to successful restoration after Ponderosa pine fire?
- How does shark behavior vary in response to human development?</p>
<p>There are no right or wrong questions - please choose something of interest to you!</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Grading<a href="#grading" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Every member of your group will receive the same score on the manuscript and presentation. An approximate length for your final completed group paper would be 15 pages, Times font, 12 pt, double-spaced, 1-inch margins. Direct language is important in scientific writing, so papers that are somewhat shorter than this will be acceptable. Much shorter, however, indicates an insufficient amount of interpretation, context, or data collection. Please use APA style for citations.</p>
<p>You will be expected to use scientific style and appropriate grammar. No matter what your eventual career may be, writing is an essential skill and will be critical to your success; therefore, points will be deducted for incorrect writing (typos, grammatical mistakes, missing or incorrect citations, unclear meaning, etc.) – this paper should be written at a professional level. If you require writing assistance, we can help you utilize the University Writing Center. The Writing Center is a resource that can help you in many classes throughout your college career. We also recommend that you share drafts with your peers and offer feedback and editing to one another. Keep in mind that this assignment is a demonstration of your level of learning and understanding of basic ecology and commit yourself to submitting the highest quality final product possible.</p>
<p>Since we will work on this project during class time, attendance is expected, with exceptions in the case of illness or emergency. At the end of the semester, you will have the ability to affect the grade of your group members (see ‘Peer performance review’). This peer performance review is meant to address significant problems, not slight differences in effort. To reduce a peer’s grade, the peer performance document must be submitted, an attempt made to correct the problematic behavior and the complaint shared with the instructor.</p>
<p>Rubrics have been provided. Please use them as a checklist to ensure that you have completed all the necessary steps for the project.</p>

<p>Reviewing published works to achieve insights from a body of literature is a common form of contributing to our scientific understanding. Bringing together the results of multiple studies is necessary to understand which patterns are consistent across systems and methodologies. A true literature review, therefore, does not just report what a host of papers and studies have found, but rather <strong>synthesizes the findings and aims for new insights</strong> that are achieved as a result of considering those papers and studies together in a single lens. Throughout this semester, we will walk through the process of conducting the literature review, analyzing the data, writing the introduction, methods, results and conclusions, and developing a scientific presentation that will be presented in front of the class during the last week of the semester.</p>

<p>This week you will form the groups (up to 4 individuals) that you will work in during the semester. You also have the option to work alone, but working in groups is a great experience! To facilitate group work, this week you will turn in a group work communication plan (if you choose to work alone, select ‘Working alone’ on the plan, and turn that in). This will serve as a contract for how you will work in groups.</p>

<p>By completing this assignment, students will develop critical skills for effectively reading, interpreting, and analyzing scientific articles. Specifically, students will:
- Learn to identify different types of scientific articles (e.g., primary research, meta-analysis, literature review, opinion pieces, and case studies) and understand their structure.
- Practice extracting key information, including the purpose, methods, results, and conclusions, by skimming abstracts and figures.
- Develop strategies for evaluating the context, strengths, and limitations of studies by engaging with the introduction, methods, and discussion sections.
- Build proficiency in assessing the quality and relevance of articles to address specific research questions or project needs.
- Gain familiarity with critical analysis techniques, such as identifying sources of bias, experimental artifacts, and the adequacy of methodologies or sample sizes.
- Enhance their ability to synthesize findings and articulate the main take-home messages from scientific papers.</p>
<p>This assignment aims to equip students with the tools necessary for navigating scientific literature, applying critical thinking, and integrating findings into their own research or projects.</p>

<p>Reading and interpreting scientific articles is an important skill for working in science-related fields, for success in this class, and for applying research in everyday life! Few researchers, will read scientific articles like a textbook (i.e., reading from the abstract to the conclusions). Rather, they focus on generating a quick understanding of the key findings, drawbacks of the study, and research implications.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Skim the article and identify the type of article and its structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>When reading an article, you want to know quickly what you are dealing with! Quickly, read the abstract.</p>
<p>Features of Abstracts
Abstracts usually contain four kinds of information:
• purpose or rationale of study (why they did it)
• methodology (how they did it)
• results (what they found)
• conclusion (what it means)</p>
<p>First, ask yourself, what type of article you are reading. This will dictate what you are looking for as you read the paper.</p>
<p>There are several primary article types:
• Primary research: Authors conducted an experiment, collected and analyzed data, and wrote-up their findings.
• Literature review: Authors systematically searched for and analyzed a set of manuscripts to draw novel insights from pre-existing research studies. Systematic means that authors used particular search terms to identify articles within a particular time period and geographic area. The search can be replicated; in other words, if someone entered the exact search terms and information, they should generate the same body of literature. All literature returned by the search is reviewed.
• Meta-analysis: Similar to a literature review, authors are drawing from previous studies (not conducting an actual experiment), but they use statistics to look across studies to quantify effects of a factor on a response variable.
o Example of a meta-analysis: Researchers looked across studies of forest thinning projects to determine the effect of thinning on the basal area of trees.
• Case study: A case study is an in-depth, detailed examination of a particular case within a real-world context.
• Opinion piece: Authors are commenting on an important topic. Usually, the opinion is supported by literature, but an opinion piece differs from a literature review, because the authors are making a particular argument and supporting with only literature that illustrates their point (not a systematic review).</p>
<p>Most journals use a conventional IMRD structure:
An abstract followed by Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. Most article types will use this structure, with the exception of the opinion piece and case studies, which may or may not follow a typical structure.</p>
<p>Based on the abstract:
Q1: What type of article are you reading?</p>
<p>Q2: What is the general topic of the article?</p>
<p>Next, flip to the figures. Based on these figures, note the significant findings and compare to the main topic that you identified in abstract. Figures typically highlight the most important points of the paper; they are a great short-cut for identifying significant findings.</p>
<p>Based on the figures:
Q3: What are the main findings of this manuscript?</p>
<p>Note: For articles that we read in class, you will need to read the articles with an eye towards discussion and thus will need to complete the entire process of reading a manuscript in this document. However, when you are reviewing literature for your class project, you may get to this point and determine that the article doesn’t address the question that you are examining, and thus may stop the process here! Be sure to note the reason for excluding the article!</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>With the understanding of the article in mind, return to the Introduction, and read with the goal of putting this article in context with previous research.</li>
</ol>
<p>Introductions serve two purposes: creating readers’ interest in the subject and providing them with enough information to understand the article. Generally, introductions accomplish this by leading readers from broad information (what is known about the topic) to more specific information (what is not known) to a focal point (what question the authors asked and answered). Thus, authors describe previous work that led to current understanding of the topic (the broad) and then situate their work (the specific) within the field.</p>
<p>Q4: Why is this study important?</p>
<p>Q5: What is the question the authors asked?</p>
<p>Q6: Do the major findings support this question?</p>
<p>Q7: Are there any terms that you don’t know? List them below and define them.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Skim the methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Methods section tells the reader what experiments were done to answer the question stated in the Introduction. Methods are often difficult to read, because of technical language and a level of detail sufficient for another trained scientist to repeat the experiments. However, there are a few things to look for, in order to identify any drawbacks of the study.</p>
<p>Choose your own adventure! In this section, only answer the questions associated with the type of article that you are reading!</p>
<p>Primary research articles:
Q8.1: If this is a primary research article, is this an observational or experimental study?</p>
<p>Q8.2: If this is a primary research article, can you identify any experimental artefacts?</p>
<p>Q8.3: If this is a primary research article, do they have an appropriate control?</p>
<p>Q8.4: Is the sample size (aka replication) sufficient to answer the question?</p>
<p>Literature review or meta-analysis:
Q8.1: Did the search terms adequately reflect the question the authors are asking?</p>
<p>Q8.2: Did the authors unnecessary exclude articles?</p>
<p>Q8.3: Is the sample size (number of articles included) sufficient to answer the question?</p>
<p>Opinion piece or case study:
Q8.1: What sources of bias are apparent in the article?
If a case study, for instance, what makes this location unique (hard to generalize findings to other places, groups or times?
If an opinion piece: Do the authors have a significant investment in putting forth a particular idea?</p>
<p>Q8.2: Do a quick search for articles with contrary findings. Are there many? What do they find?</p>
<p>Q8.3: Did the authors represent these contrary findings or viewpoints in their article?</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the discussion
The discussion is where the authors interpret results and contextualize findings within the extant scientific literature. This is in many ways the most information-rich part of the paper!</li>
</ol>
<p>Q9: Did the authors discuss caveats and limitations to the research? What were they and did they align with issues that you identified?</p>
<p>Q10: What was the take home message?</p>

<p>Summary: Importance of Information Literacy and Using Databases</p>
<p>The Role of Information Literacy in Science</p>
<p>Information literacy is critical for scientists and applied scientists to:</p>
<pre><code>1.  Access and build on prior research to make informed decisions.
2.  Record and store discoveries in accessible sources for future use.
3.  Use appropriate skills to find, interpret, and use these sources effectively.</code></pre>
<p>Conditions for Effective Research</p>
<p>For research to be useful, the following must be met:
1. Discoveries must be recorded: Stored in journals, conference papers, and databases.
2. Sources must be findable: Accessible through databases and search tools.
3. Sources must be accessible: Libraries and subscriptions play a crucial role.
4. Researchers need skills: Searching databases, using keywords, and critically evaluating sources are essential.</p>
<p>Types of Databases
1. Article Databases: Focus on journal articles and other publications (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science).
2. Publisher Databases: Contain works from specific publishers (e.g., IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink).
3. E-print Databases: Provide pre-print and post-print manuscripts (e.g., arXiv).</p>
<p>Using Article Databases
- Article databases allow efficient searches for journal articles, conference papers, and more.
- Examples by discipline include:
- Biology: BIOSIS, Web of Science, Scopus
- Medicine: PubMed
- Engineering: IEEE Xplore
- Psychology: PsycINFO</p>
<p>For this assignment, you must use a database - such as Web of Science or Scopus - not Google Scholar!</p>
<p>Google Scholar vs. Library Databases
- Google Scholar: Useful for quick searches but lacks advanced search features and curation. Use this to find pdfs identified during your search.
- Library Databases: Provide curated content and robust search tools, ensuring quality and reliability. Ensures that you can reproduce your literature search!</p>
<p>Choosing Databases
- Use article databases for comprehensive searches across publishers.
- Publisher databases are useful in disciplines dominated by a single publisher.
- E-print databases can supplement, but caution is needed when using pre-prints.</p>
<p>Final Note: Mastering information literacy and database use equips researchers to access and utilize high-quality information efficiently, contributing to academic and professional success.</p>
</div>
<div id="search-terms" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.3.3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Search terms<a href="#search-terms" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Three-Step Process for Expert Searching
1. Select essential keywords: Focus on the fewest, most critical terms that represent the topic.
2. Gather synonyms: Expand the search with alternative terms to cover variations in language or phrasing.
3. Use Boolean searches: Combine keywords and synonyms with operators like AND, OR, and NOT to refine and broaden searches effectively.</p>
<p>Boolean Searching Example
- Search: fires OR wildfire AND Arizona AND streams OR rivers
- Result: Retrieves articles containing any of the synonyms, ensuring broader coverage of relevant sources.</p>
<p>Database Search Features
- Field-specific searching: Target keywords in specific parts of records (e.g., titles, abstracts).
- Sorting options: Organize results by relevance, citation count, or publication date.
- Filters: Narrow results by language, publication type, date, or population group (e.g., human studies in PubMed).</p>
<p>Strategies for Advanced Searching
1. Citation chaining: Examine references cited in a paper or articles citing it.
2. Related articles: Use tools like Google Scholar’s “Related Articles” to find similar studies.
3. Author searches: Look for additional works by the same author(s) to explore their contributions further.</p>
<p>Search Efficiency: Databases vs. Google Scholar
- Databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science): Offer curated content, advanced filters, and specialized tools tailored to disciplines.
- Google Scholar: Quick and broad but lacks robust filtering, leading to less precise results.</p>
<p>Specialized Techniques
1. Quotation marks: For exact phrases (e.g., “Grand Canyon”).
2. Asterisks: Capture word variations (e.g., comput* for compute, computing, computer).
3. Filters in databases: Use discipline-specific filters to refine searches further (e.g., randomized controlled trials in PubMed).</p>
<p>Common Pitfalls
- Incomplete searches can result in missing critical information.
- Students often overlook seeking librarian support, which can significantly save time and improve search quality.</p>
<p>When you write your methods, you will need to explicitly detail the terms you searched, including Boolean operators, synonyms, asterisk, and quotes. If you do not include this information, you will not receive full points, so please document your search carefully.</p>
<p>Final Note: Search skills go beyond finding “good enough” results. They require thoughtful planning, use of tools like Boolean logic, and leveraging database features to ensure comprehensive, high-quality research outcomes.</p>

<p>When conducting a literature review, systematically organizing and synthesizing the information from your sources is essential to build a strong foundation for your research. Coding information from manuscripts allows you to identify patterns, themes, and knowledge gaps while ensuring transparency and replicability in your review process. Coding involves creating a structured datasheet where each source is represented by a row, and the columns correspond to specific themes or factors of interest.</p>
<p>This approach not only helps organize your findings but also serves as a foundation for your methods section, where you detail the process of analyzing your sources. Additionally, the themes identified in your coding table can inform the structure of your discussion, providing clear headings and subheadings.</p>
<div id="why-code-information" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="6.1">
<h2 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Why Code Information?<a href="#why-code-information" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<pre><code>1.  Structure and Organization: Coding ensures you capture key elements from every source and organize them systematically.
2.  Synthesis: Identifying recurring themes or factors across studies allows you to draw meaningful conclusions.
3.  Transparency: Including a coding table in your methods section provides a clear record of your process.
4.  Discussion Framework: Themes in the table can guide the structure of your discussion, helping readers follow your narrative.</code></pre>

<p>In the previous weeks of class, you have developed a research question, conducted a literature search, and identified literature to review. During your literature search process, you should have downloaded both the RIS file to enter into your citation manager AND an <strong>excel file that has your citations listed</strong>. This citation spreadsheet will become the basis of your coding table.</p>
<div id="design-your-coding-table" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="6.2.1">
<h3 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Design Your Coding Table<a href="#design-your-coding-table" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Create a spreadsheet or table with the following features:</p>
<pre><code>- Rows: Each row represents a single source or citation.
- Columns: Each column corresponds to a theme, factor, or piece of information you are extracting from the study (e.g., climate, disease dynamics, disturbance proximity, methods used, study location).</code></pre>
<p>For ease, modify the excel file that you downloaded. Much of the information from the file can be deleted for ease of review, but retain: the citation, date of publication, and location of publication, or any other information that you would like to capture to describe the state of literature related to your topic.</p>
<p>Developing themes in a systematic literature review involves identifying patterns, concepts, and recurring ideas across multiple studies to synthesize findings meaningfully. The process begins by reading and coding the articles, focusing on key aspects such as research questions, methodologies, findings, and limitations. As you review the data, group similar ideas into preliminary categories. For instance, studies on ecological restoration might reveal themes like “restoration techniques,” “biodiversity outcomes,” or “climate adaptation.” Iteratively refine these categories as you read more, ensuring they accurately reflect the breadth and nuances of the literature. Use tools like spreadsheets, qualitative coding software, or conceptual mapping to organize and visualize these themes. Lastly, critically analyze the themes to identify gaps, contradictions, or emerging trends, which can guide your synthesis and highlight areas for future research. The goal is to develop themes that capture the essence of the body of work while remaining flexible enough to adapt to new insights as the review progresses.</p>

<h1 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Ethical Use of AI for Student Projects<a href="#ethical-use-of-ai-for-student-projects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>AI tools, such as ChatGPT and other language models, can be valuable resources when used appropriately in academic work. However, it is crucial for students to understand the ethical boundaries of using AI in their projects to ensure academic integrity and personal learning growth.</p>
<p>Acceptable Uses of AI
1. Editing and Proofreading
• Students may use AI to check their grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.
• AI can help refine writing by suggesting more concise or clearer ways to express ideas.
2. Idea Generation
• Students can use AI for brainstorming topics or approaches for their projects.
• AI can provide alternative perspectives or help students explore potential areas of inquiry.
3. Clarifying Concepts
• AI can be used as a supplemental tool to explain scientific concepts or terms students may not fully understand.
• Students can ask AI to rephrase or simplify explanations found in research articles or class materials.
4. Organizing Research
• AI tools can assist with creating summaries of articles, identifying key points, or organizing thoughts into structured outlines.
5. Citations and Formatting
• AI can help generate proper citations and bibliographies, though students should double-check for accuracy.
• Formatting assistance for academic styles like APA, MLA, or Chicago is a valid use.
6. Code Assistance
• For projects requiring programming, AI may help troubleshoot errors, explain coding concepts, or suggest improvements in scripts or algorithms.</p>
<p>Unacceptable Uses of AI
1. Writing Original Content
• Students must write their own reports, essays, or project descriptions. AI-generated text should not substitute for original student work.
• Using AI to create entire paragraphs or sections is considered academic dishonesty unless explicitly allowed by the instructor.
2. Bypassing the Learning Process
• Students should not use AI to generate answers to assignments, especially when the purpose is to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
3. Plagiarism
• Copying and pasting AI-generated text without proper citation, even if AI contributed minimally, is considered plagiarism.
4. Fabricating Data or Results
• AI must not be used to create fake data, results, or analyses that misrepresent actual findings.</p>
<p>Guidelines for Ethical Use
1. Transparency
• If students use AI tools for editing, organizing, or brainstorming, they must disclose this in their project documentation or acknowledgments.
2. Instructor Approval
• When in doubt, students should consult with the instructor about whether a specific use of AI is permissible for a given assignment.
3. Cite AI Contributions
• If students use AI for brainstorming or editing, they should acknowledge its role (e.g., “This text was reviewed and refined with the assistance of AI-based proofreading tools”).
4. Focus on Learning
• Students should use AI as a learning tool rather than a shortcut, ensuring that they fully understand the material and can demonstrate their knowledge independently.
5. Critical Evaluation
• Any content or suggestion from AI should be critically evaluated by the student for accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness to their work.</p>
<p>Incorporating AI in the Project</p>
<p>For this class project, students are encouraged to:
• Use AI to refine their grammar and structure but not to generate original text.
• Leverage AI to clarify complex concepts or organize their thoughts into outlines.
• Practice transparency by acknowledging the use of AI where applicable.</p>
<p>By adhering to these guidelines, students can ethically and effectively use AI tools to enhance their academic work while upholding the principles of academic integrity and personal accountability.</p>

<p>Summary for Class Presentation on Scientific Writing</p>
<p>Key Points on Scientific Writing:
1. Conciseness and Precision:
• Avoid needless words and overly complex phrases.
• Replace multi-word phrases with simpler equivalents (e.g., “due to the fact that” → “because”).
• Use precise scientific language when describing concepts or findings.
2. Clarity and Simplicity:
• Prefer straightforward words over complex ones (e.g., “used” instead of “utilized”).
• Simplify sentences by reducing passive voice and ensuring the subject performs the action (active voice preferred).
3. Cohesion and Coherence:
• Ensure logical transitions between sentences and ideas (cohesion).
• Maintain focus on the main topic within each paragraph, with a clear opening and closing sentence (coherence).
• Use ‘thought-chaining,’ where the last idea in one sentence leads to the first idea in the next.
4. Effective Sentence Structure:
• Keep subjects close to their verbs to avoid reader confusion.
• Use simple subjects, splitting complex ones into multiple sentences if needed.
5. Emphasizing Important Information:
• Begin sentences with familiar (old) information and place new information at the end.
• Highlight key points in the first and last sentences of each paragraph.
6. Adjective and Adverb Usage:
• Use adjectives and adverbs sparingly to avoid unnecessary embellishments.
• Remove overused modifiers like “very” and “extremely” unless essential.
7. Citing and Avoiding Plagiarism:
• Always rephrase ideas in your own words.
• Properly attribute all sources; avoid quoting directly unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Revision Techniques:
• Search and replace wordy phrases or overly complex language.
• Simplify subjects and rephrase sentences to bring clarity.
• Review first and last sentences of paragraphs to ensure they match and reinforce the main idea.
• Highlight adjectives and adverbs, removing any that don’t add meaningful value.</p>
<p>Activity for Students:
• Step 1: Revise a draft of your work to remove redundant words and simplify language.
• Step 2: Identify instances of passive voice and rewrite sentences in active voice.
• Step 3: Ensure logical flow and coherence by revisiting paragraph structure and transitions.
• Step 4: Highlight new and old information in your sentences, restructuring for emphasis where needed.
• Step 5: Proofread for proper citation and adherence to scientific writing principles.</p>
<p>This approach will guide students in refining their writing for clarity, precision, and professional presentation. Following the lecture, students will have an opportunity to edit their drafts based on these principles.</p>

<li><p>Design Your Slides
• Use Visuals:
• Prioritize graphs, charts, and images over text.
• Ensure visuals are high-resolution and labeled clearly.
• Keep It Simple:
• Follow the “6x6 rule”: No more than 6 words per bullet and 6 bullets per slide.
• Use plenty of white space for readability.
• Maintain Consistency:
• Choose a professional theme and stick to a color palette.
• Use consistent font types and sizes (e.g., 28-point for headings, 24-point for body text).
• Engage With Animations Sparingly:
• Use animations only to emphasize key points or reveal complex data step-by-step.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice Clear Communication
• Rehearse Your Delivery:
• Practice multiple times to refine timing and fluency.
• Record yourself to identify areas for improvement.
• Engage With the Audience:
• Maintain eye contact, use natural gestures, and vary your tone.
• Prepare for questions by anticipating potential queries related to your work.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Checks
• Proofread Slides: Look for typos, inconsistencies, and technical inaccuracies.
• Check Formatting: Ensure slides appear correctly on the chosen platform and on different devices (e.g., projector, laptop).
• Test Technology:
• Test your presentation in the actual venue if possible.
• Bring backups on a USB drive and email a copy to yourself.</p></li>
