## Background

### Information literacy

#### Importance of Information Literacy

Information literacy is crucial for anyone pursuing a career in science or applied science disciplines. It enables you to:

1.	Stay Updated: Scientists and practitioners must continually educate themselves on best practices and emerging discoveries.
2.	Build on Knowledge: Research relies on understanding and extending prior studies. New discoveries don’t arise from a vacuum—they stem from the accumulation of earlier findings.
3.	Make Informed Decisions: Whether designing experiments, creating policies, or treating patients, credible and relevant information is the foundation for sound decision-making.

Key Aspects of Information Literacy in Science:

1.	Access to Reliable Sources: Scientists must be able to find, access, and utilize high-quality resources like journal articles, databases, and textbooks. Libraries and institutional subscriptions play a vital role in providing access to such materials.
2.	Critical Evaluation: Beyond finding information, researchers need to evaluate its relevance, reliability, and limitations. For example, distinguishing between primary research, review articles, and predatory journals is essential.
3.	Effective Searching: Developing advanced search skills, such as using databases, Boolean operators, and keywords, helps researchers find the most relevant information without missing critical studies.
4.	Citation and Credibility: Properly citing sources ensures academic integrity and acknowledges prior work, contributing to the collective knowledge in the field.

Applications in Science and Careers: 

- Research and Innovation: From understanding nitrogen’s impact on ecosystems to studying wildfire effects on water quality, every discovery builds on prior studies.
- Policy Development: Information literacy aids in creating evidence-based policies, such as strategies for improving public health or environmental conservation.
- Professional Growth: Mastery of these skills helps professionals stay competitive, make informed decisions, and contribute meaningfully to their fields.

#### Takeaways

- Information is a System: Knowledge progresses because discoveries are documented, made findable through databases, and accessible through libraries.
- You Are Integral: Your ability to find, access, and synthesize information directly impacts your effectiveness as a scientist.
- Practical Benefits: From avoiding misinformation to excelling in academic and professional projects, information literacy underpins success.

By mastering these skills, you’ll not only thrive in your academic and career pursuits but also contribute to advancing science in meaningful ways.

### Databases

For this project, you will be selecting an article database accessed through the Cline Library to conduct your search (**not google scholar, and not the quick search on the Cline library webpage**). Article databases allow efficient and reproducible searches for journal articles, conference papers, and more. Google Scholar is useful for quick searches but lacks advanced search features and curation. You may use google scholar to find pdfs identified during your search.

Examples of article databases by discipline include:
	- Biology: BIOSIS, Web of Science, Scopus
	- Medicine: PubMed
	- Engineering: IEEE Xplore
	- Psychology: PsycINFO
	
### Search terms

Once you have select a database to search, you must develop search terms.

Three-step process for building search terms:

1.	Select essential keywords: Focus on the fewest, most critical terms that represent the topic.
2.	Gather synonyms: Expand the search with alternative terms to cover variations in language or phrasing.
3.	Use Boolean searches: Combine keywords and synonyms with operators like AND, OR, and NOT to refine and broaden searches effectively.

Make decisions about database parameters. Each database should like you make the following decisions about how you search the database:

1. Field-specific searching: Target keywords in specific parts of records (e.g., titles, abstracts).
2. Sorting options: Organize results by relevance, citation count, or publication date.
3. Filters: Narrow results by language, publication type, date, or population group (e.g., human studies in PubMed).
	
Specialized search techniques:

1.	Quotation marks: For exact phrases (e.g., "Grand Canyon").
2.	Asterisks: Capture word variations (e.g., comput* for compute, computing, computer).
3.	Filters in databases: Use discipline-specific filters to refine searches further (e.g., randomized controlled trials in PubMed).

For other projects (not necessary for this project), if you would like to identify additional publications, you may choose to:

1.	Use citation chaining: Examine references cited in a paper or articles citing it.
2.	Identify related articles: Use tools like Google Scholar’s “Related Articles” to find similar studies.
3.	Employ author searches: Look for additional works by the same author(s) to explore their contributions further.

Remember that you can always seek librarian support, which can significantly save time and improve search quality. When you write your methods, you will need to explicitly detail the terms you searched, including Boolean operators, synonyms, asterisk, and quotes. If you do not include this information, you will not receive full points, so please document your search carefully.

## Procedure

For this project, you will conduct a search, refine your question based on search results, and export a RIS file, which you will upload to a citation manager. Here is the step-by-step process to complete this activity:

1. Select a database: Scopus, Web of Science
2. Using the methods described above (Boolean operators, etc), search the database.
3. Refine your search: You are aiming to review 20 - 100 papers. 

If your search is too broad, you will return too many papers. In order to reduce this number, try adding additional criteria, such as:

- Add a place. i.e., Colorado Plateau, Southwest, Arizona
- Add a global change component. i.e. How are bird migrations expected to shift as a function of climate change?
- Add an interaction. i.e., How are Saguaro cacti affected by mycorrhizae?
- Add a time. i.e., What threats to shark populations have emerged within the last 10 years?

4. Once you have an appropriate number of citations, export the RIS file to upload later into your citation manager, as well as an excel file of your literature. 

**Pro-tip**: Upload your citations, as a google sheet so that each member can review papers.

## Deliverables

Please turn in the worksheet. **Note**: This will worksheet will be used to help you start writing your methods section! Also, download and retain your **RIS file** and your **excel file** of your citations! You will use these for future workshops!!!
