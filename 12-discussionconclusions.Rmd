How to Write the Discussion and Conclusions Sections of a Scientific Manuscript

## Discussion

The Discussion section is your opportunity to interpret your results, place them within the context of existing knowledge, and articulate their significance. Here’s how to approach it effectively:

1.	Organize by Themes:

- Divide the section into subsections based on dominant themes or key findings.
- Each subsection should correspond to a major point or question your research addresses.

2.	Provide Context:

- Compare your results with previous studies to highlight consistencies, contradictions, or novel findings.
- Properly cite relevant literature to connect your results to broader scientific understanding.

3.	Interpret Results:

- Explain the significance of your findings and their implications.
- Address unexpected results or potential limitations and how they might influence your conclusions.

4.	Link Back to Objectives:

- Revisit the hypotheses or research questions posed in the introduction.
- Discuss how your findings answer those questions or open new avenues of inquiry.

## Conclusions

The Conclusions section provides a succinct wrap-up of your manuscript. Here’s how to craft this section:

1.	Summarize Your Review:

- Provide a brief recap of your main findings and their significance.
- Avoid repeating detailed results from earlier sections.

2.	Highlight Key Takeaways:

- Identify the most important findings that contribute to the field.
	
3.	Discuss Implications:

- Explain how your research impacts the current understanding of the topic.
- Mention potential applications of your findings.

4.	Propose Future Directions:

- Suggest specific areas or questions for further research based on your work.

## Tips for Success

Please make sure that you ensure proper citation of all referenced studies to maintain credibility. Feel free to use visuals, like tables or models, if they help clarify complex ideas.

## Deliverables

Turn in your discussion. Each group member should take one topic for the discussion to compose. Depending on your group size, one member may need to write the conclusions. If your group is small, draft one paragraph of the discussion, but outline the rest of the discussion for your presentation.
