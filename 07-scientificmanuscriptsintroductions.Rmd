# Scientific manuscripts and introductions

## Structuring a Scientific Manuscript

Scientific manuscripts typically follow an “hourglass” structure, transitioning from broad context to specific details and then back to broader implications. This is the general structure of a scientific paper:

1.	Introduction (Broad → Specific):

- Begin with a broad context to engage your audience and highlight the relevance of your work.
- Narrow the focus to your specific research topic.
- Define the knowledge gap your study addresses.
- End with a clear research question or hypothesis.

2.	Methods (Specific):

- Detail the experimental setup, data collection, and analytical techniques.
- Ensure transparency and reproducibility.

3.	Results (Specific):

- Present your findings with supporting data (e.g., figures, tables).
- Avoid interpretation in this section—focus on the “what.”

4.	Discussion and Conclusions (Specific → Broad):

- Interpret the results and link them to the broader context.
- Discuss implications, limitations, and future research directions.

## Extra parts: Title, Abstract, Acknowledgements, and Literature Cited

- **Title**: Make the title concise and informative to attract the right audience. Include this on your title page, along with the names of the manuscript's authors. 
- **Abstract**: Summarize the manuscript’s key points:
  - You should plan on including 1 - 2 sentences per section (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion/Conclusions) that briefly describes the main points of that section.
  - The abstract is often created last. Please put this on the title page, below the **title**, and **authors' names**.
- **Acknowledgements**: Thank any one that contributed to the paper - be sure to credit AI or other resources that you used to complete your manuscript. Place this at the end of your manuscript after figures and tables, but before the literature cited.
- **Literature Cited**: Use your citation manager to create your bibliography. Be sure to edit citations for errors within Zotero.

## Writing an Effective Introduction

The introduction is crucial for setting the stage and drawing readers into your manuscript. It should seamlessly transition from broad background information to the specific objectives of your study. Follow these steps:

1.	Set the Stage:

- Explain why the research topic is important.
- Use current data, trends, or challenges to provide context.
- **Example**: “Global climate change has accelerated shifts in species distributions, raising critical questions about ecosystem resilience and biodiversity management.”

2.	Introduce Concepts:

- Define key terms and introduce foundational concepts relevant to your study.
- Include citations from the literature to establish credibility.
- **Example**: “Ecological resilience refers to an ecosystem’s capacity to absorb disturbances while maintaining essential functions.”

3.	Identify the Knowledge Gap:

- Highlight what is currently known and what remains unclear or unanswered.
- Emphasize how your study addresses this gap.
- **Example**: “Despite advances in understanding resilience mechanisms, little is known about how species interactions influence recovery trajectories in post-fire environments.”

4.	End with the Research Question or Objective:

- Clearly state what your study aims to achieve or investigate.
- This statement should naturally flow from the preceding context.
- **Example**: “This study examines the role of keystone species in post-fire ecological recovery to provide insights into effective conservation strategies.”

5. Writing Style for Introductions:

As with all scientific writing, be sure that it is:

- Concise and Logical: Avoid unnecessary details—focus on clarity and relevance.
- Engaging: Use active voice and compelling statements to maintain interest.
- Well-Cited: Use references to support claims and establish credibility.

## Deliverables

Draft your introduction and submit on canvas. The introduction does not need to be lengthy: It should be between 1 - 2 pages.
