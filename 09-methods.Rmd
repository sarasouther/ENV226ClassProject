# Methods 

The Methods section of a scientific paper explains how the research was conducted, allowing others to replicate the study or assess its reliability. Today, we will draft a methods section for your literature review. 

## Purpose of the Methods Section
	
- Enables reproducibility: Provides enough detail for others to replicate the study.
- Establishes credibility: Shows that your research methods are sound and scientifically valid.
- Provides transparency: Explains the rationale behind the methodological choices.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Define the Scope of Your Methods:

- What: Clearly outline the search terms, tools, or procedures used in your research. Include any software, equipment, or frameworks.
	- Example: Search terms like "forest fires" AND "water quality" or Boolean operators like AND, OR.
- When: Specify the time frame when the research or experiment was conducted.
	- Example: “Searches were conducted from January 1 to March 31, 2024.”
- Where: List the database(s) or tools utilized (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science, or field sampling locations).
	- Example: “Data were collected using Scopus and analyzed using R statistical software.”
- How: Describe the criteria for including or excluding sources or subjects, how you identified themes, and any other procedural information.
	- Example: “Studies were excluded if they lacked quantitative data or were not peer-reviewed.”
  - Example: “Abstracts were rejected if they did not include geographic or temporal data on forest fires.”
  - Example: Themes like “climate resilience” or “fire recovery.”

*Key Tips*:

For a great methods section, remember to:

- Structure your section logically:

    - Break it into subsections with headings for clarity:
    
    	  - Data Collection
    	  - Classification
    	  - Analysis
    	  
    - Within sections chronological: 
    
        - Describe the steps in the order they occurred.
- Justify your choices: Explain why you chose specific methods over alternatives.
- Be transparent about limitations: Acknowledge challenges in your methodology.
- Be precise and use standard terminology
	- Avoid ambiguous language. Use clear, concise sentences with technical terms where necessary.
	  - Example: Instead of “a small number of samples,” specify “10 soil samples were collected.”
- Remember to create your coding table:
 - Read abstracts and categorize articles based on their relevance to research themes.
 - Record each decision and theme in a coding table.

## Example Opening of a Methods Section

“Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using the terms "forest fires" AND "water quality" for studies published between 2010 and 2024. Abstracts were screened for relevance, and articles were included if they contained quantitative data on nitrogen runoff. Studies were excluded if they were not peer-reviewed or lacked geographic data. Data were coded for themes including ‘fire severity,’ ‘nitrogen leaching,’ and ‘stream health.’ Statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.3 using the lme4 package.”

## Deliverables

Turn in your methods section. This should be between 0.5 and 1 page.
