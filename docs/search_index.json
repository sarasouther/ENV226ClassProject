This project will walk you through several critical aspects of conducting scientific research, including searching scientific databases, evaluating informational quality, analyzing literature, summarizing information, and writing-up your process and findings in a scientifically rigorous manner. In this way, this project addresses the course’s student learning objectives (below) and builds several core competencies required for a career in the sciences or other fields. 1.1 Student Learning Objectives Apply the scientific method, identify and interpret scientific literature. Competencies: Career &amp; Self-Development: Proactively develop oneself and one’s career through continual personal and professional learning, awareness of one’s strengths and weaknesses, navigation of career opportunities, and networking to build relationships within and without one’s organization. Professionalism: Knowing work environments differ greatly, understand and demonstrate effective work habits, and act in the interest of the larger community and workplace. Teamwork: Build and maintain collaborative relationships to work effectively toward common goals, while appreciating diverse viewpoints and shared responsibilities. Technology: Understand and leverage technologies ethically to enhance efficiencies, complete tasks, and accomplish goals. 1.2 Downloads Download rubrics here: Final paper rubric Presentation rubric 1.3 Description Working alone or in groups of up to 4, you will perform a literature review of an ecological topic of your choosing. You will present your work both in the form of a manuscript and a presentation. There are different forms of literature reviews - we will be going further than the literature reviews typically performed for a lab report or other class project. Instead, we will perform a systematic literature review. A systematic literature review is similar to conducting research in the lab, except instead of collecting data on living organisms, you will collect data on a body of literature. To do this, you will first select a question of interest. Your questions may address any topic in ecology - examining how organisms relate to one another and to their environment. The only qualifier is that there must be enough literature published on the topic to generate novel insights, by examining and summarizing the literature. As an example, here are some questions from previous years: How will climate change affect Pinyon species in the Southwest? What factors lead to successful restoration after Ponderosa pine fire? How does shark behavior vary in response to human development? There are no right or wrong questions - please choose something of interest to you! 1.4 Grading Every member of your group will receive the same score on the manuscript and presentation. An approximate length for your final completed group paper would be 15 pages, Times font, 12 pt, double-spaced, 1-inch margins. Direct language is important in scientific writing, so papers that are somewhat shorter than this will be acceptable. Much shorter, however, indicates an insufficient amount of interpretation, context, or data collection. Please use APA style for citations. You will be expected to use scientific style and appropriate grammar. No matter what your eventual career may be, writing is an essential skill and will be critical to your success; therefore, points will be deducted for incorrect writing (typos, grammatical mistakes, missing or incorrect citations, unclear meaning, etc.) – this paper should be written at a professional level. If you require writing assistance, we can help you utilize the University Writing Center. The Writing Center is a resource that can help you in many classes throughout your college career. We also recommend that you share drafts with your peers and offer feedback and editing to one another. Keep in mind that this assignment is a demonstration of your level of learning and understanding of basic ecology and commit yourself to submitting the highest quality final product possible. Since we will work on this project during class time, attendance is expected, with exceptions in the case of illness or emergency. At the end of the semester, you will have the ability to affect the grade of your group members (see ‘Peer performance review’). This peer performance review is meant to address significant problems, not slight differences in effort. To reduce a peer’s grade, the peer performance document must be submitted, an attempt made to correct the problematic behavior and the complaint shared with the instructor. Rubrics have been provided. Please use them as a checklist to ensure that you have completed all the necessary steps for the project. 1.5 Overview Reviewing published works to achieve insights from a body of literature is a common form of contributing to our scientific understanding. Bringing together the results of multiple studies is necessary to understand which patterns are consistent across systems and methodologies. A true literature review, therefore, does not just report what a host of papers and studies have found, but rather synthesizes the findings and aims for new insights that are achieved as a result of considering those papers and studies together in a single lens. Throughout this semester, we will walk through the process of conducting the literature review, analyzing the data, writing the introduction, methods, results and conclusions, and developing a scientific presentation that will be presented in front of the class during the last week of the semester. "],["working-in-groups.html", "Chapter 2 Working in groups 2.1 Downloads 2.2 Deliverables", " Chapter 2 Working in groups This week you will form the groups (up to 4 individuals). During the semester, you will work with your team to complete the final paper and presentation. You also have the option to work alone, but working in groups is a great experience! For all activities related to the project, I ask each group member to turn in an assignment - this helps me track attendance. For the final paper and presentation, you will recieve the same grade as your group members, and you will only need to turn in one final paper. To facilitate group work, this week you will turn in a group work communication plan (if you choose to work alone, select ‘Working alone’ on the plan, and turn that in). The communication plan will serve as a contract for how you will work in groups. Since you have the option to influence the final grade of your groupmates, please be sure to document and address any problems as they arise.

Specifically, you will: Learn to identify different types of scientific articles (e.g., primary research, meta-analysis, literature review, opinion pieces, and case studies) and understand their structure. Practice extracting key information, including the purpose, methods, results, and conclusions, by skimming abstracts and figures. Develop strategies for evaluating the context, strengths, and limitations of studies by engaging with the introduction, methods, and discussion sections. Build proficiency in assessing the quality and relevance of articles to address specific research questions or project needs. Gain familiarity with critical analysis techniques, such as identifying sources of bias, experimental artifacts, and the adequacy of methodologies or sample sizes. Enhance their ability to synthesize findings and articulate the main take-home messages from scientific papers. This assignment aims to equip students with the tools necessary for navigating scientific literature, applying critical thinking, and integrating findings into their own research or projects. 3.2 Downloads Word document to fill out and turn-in Manuscript to review 3.3 Background and activity Reading and interpreting scientific articles is an important skill for working in science-related fields, for success in this class, and for applying research in everyday life! Few researchers, will read scientific articles like a textbook (i.e., reading from the abstract to the conclusions). Rather, they focus on generating a quick understanding of the key findings, drawbacks of the study, and research implications. 3.3.1 Skim the article When reading an article, you want to know quickly what you are dealing with! Quickly, read the abstract. Abstracts usually contain four kinds of information: purpose or rationale of study (why they did it) methodology (how they did it) results (what they found) conclusion (what it means) 3.3.2 Identify the type of article There are several primary article types: Primary research: Authors conducted an experiment, collected and analyzed data, and wrote-up their findings. Literature review: Authors systematically searched for and analyzed a set of manuscripts to draw novel insights from pre-existing research studies. Systematic means that authors used particular search terms to identify articles within a particular time period and geographic area. The search can be replicated; in other words, if someone entered the exact search terms and information, they should generate the same body of literature. All literature returned by the search is reviewed. Meta-analysis: Similar to a literature review, authors are drawing from previous studies (not conducting an actual experiment), but they use statistics to look across studies to quantify effects of a factor on a response variable. - Example of a meta-analysis: Researchers looked across studies of forest thinning projects to determine the effect of thinning on the basal area of trees. Case study: A case study is an in-depth, detailed examination of a particular case within a real-world context. Opinion piece: Authors are commenting on an important topic. Usually, the opinion is supported by literature, but an opinion piece differs from a literature review, because the authors are making a particular argument and supporting with only literature that illustrates their point (not a systematic review). Most journals use a conventional IMRD structure: An abstract followed by Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. Most article types will use this structure, with the exception of the opinion piece and case studies, which may or may not follow a typical structure. On the document that you downloaded you will find the questions presented here. Walk through your review of the article answering the questions within the document: 3.3.3 Review the abstract What type of article are you reading? What is the general topic of the article? 3.3.4 Glance at the figures Next, flip to the figures. Based on these figures, note the significant findings and compare to the main topic that you identified in abstract. Figures typically highlight the most important points of the paper; they are a great short-cut for identifying significant findings. Based on the figures: What are the main findings of this manuscript? Note: For articles that we read in class, you will need to read the articles with an eye towards discussion and thus will need to complete the entire process of reading a manuscript in this document. However, when you are reviewing literature for your class project, you may get to this point and determine that the article doesn’t address the question that you are examining, and thus may stop the process here! Be sure to note the reason for excluding the article! 3.3.5 Read the introduction With the understanding of the article in mind, return to the Introduction, and read with the goal of putting this article in context with previous research.Introductions serve two purposes: creating readers’ interest in the subject and providing them with enough information to understand the article. Generally, introductions accomplish this by leading readers from broad information (what is known about the topic) to more specific information (what is not known) to a focal point (what question the authors asked and answered). Thus, authors describe previous work that led to current understanding of the topic (the broad) and then situate their work (the specific) within the field. Based on the introduction, answer these questions: Why is this study important? What is the question the authors asked? Do the major findings support this question? Are there any terms that you don’t know? List them below and define them. 3.3.6 Skim the methods. The Methods section tells the reader what experiments were done to answer the question stated in the Introduction. Methods are often difficult to read, because of technical language and a level of detail sufficient for another trained scientist to repeat the experiments. However, there are a few things to look for, in order to identify any drawbacks of the study. Choose your own adventure! In this section, only answer the questions associated with the type of article that you are reading! 3.3.6.1 Primary research articles If you are reading a primary research article, answer these questions: 8.1. If this is a primary research article, is this an observational or experimental study? 8.2. If this is a primary research article, can you identify any experimental artefacts? 8.3. If this is a primary research article, do they have an appropriate control? 8.4. Is the sample size (aka replication) sufficient to answer the question? 3.3.6.2 Literature review or meta-analysis If you are reading a literature review or meta-analysis, answer these questions: 8.1. Did the search terms adequately reflect the question the authors are asking? 8.2. Did the authors unnecessary exclude articles? 8.3. Is the sample size (number of articles included) sufficient to answer the question? 3.3.6.3 Opinion piece or case study If you are reading an opinion piece or case study, please answer these questions: 8.1. What sources of bias are apparent in the article? If a case study, for instance, what makes this location unique (hard to generalize findings to other places, groups or times? If an opinion piece: Do the authors have a significant investment in putting forth a particular idea? 8.2. Do a quick search for articles with contrary findings. Are there many? What do they find? 8.3. Did the authors represent these contrary findings or viewpoints in their article? 3.3.7 Read the discussion The discussion is where the authors interpret results and contextualize findings within the extant scientific literature. This is in many ways the most information-rich part of the paper! Based on the article, answer the following questions: 9: Did the authors discuss caveats and limitations to the research? What were they and did they align with issues that you identified? 10: What was the take home message? 3.4 Deliverables Please turn-in your completed to Canvas.

Document to complete 5.2 Learning objectives By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: Understand the Importance of Information Literacy: Explain why information literacy is critical for scientific research and professional success in applied sciences. Identify the key components of information literacy, including access, evaluation, and proper use of information sources. Navigate Scientific Databases: Differentiate between various types of databases (e.g., article, publisher, e-print) and their applications. Select and utilize discipline-specific databases like PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Develop Effective Search Strategies: Employ the three-step process for expert searching: Identify essential keywords. Expand searches using synonyms. Construct Boolean searches using operators like AND, OR, and NOT. Apply advanced search techniques such as quotation marks, asterisks, and filters to refine results. Evaluate and Document Sources: Assess sources for relevance, credibility, and reliability, distinguishing between primary research articles, review articles, and pre-prints. Document search strategies explicitly, including Boolean logic, synonyms, and database filters, to ensure reproducibility. Compare Search Tools: Understand the limitations of Google Scholar and the advantages of library databases for thorough, curated research. Use Google Scholar strategically for locating PDFs of articles identified in searches. Utilize Advanced Techniques: Implement strategies such as citation chaining, related articles searches, and author searches to broaden the scope of research. Leverage database-specific tools for sorting, filtering, and refining search results. Apply Research Methods to Projects: Integrate search results effectively into class projects and presentations, adhering to ethical standards for citation and use of information. Write clear and detailed methods sections, documenting the search process comprehensively to ensure credit and reproducibility. 5.3 Background 5.3.1 Information literacy 5.3.1.1 Importance of Information Literacy Information literacy is crucial for anyone pursuing a career in science or applied science disciplines. It enables you to: Stay Updated: Scientists and practitioners must continually educate themselves on best practices and emerging discoveries. Build on Knowledge: Research relies on understanding and extending prior studies. New discoveries don’t arise from a vacuum—they stem from the accumulation of earlier findings. Make Informed Decisions: Whether designing experiments, creating policies, or treating patients, credible and relevant information is the foundation for sound decision-making. Key Aspects of Information Literacy in Science: Access to Reliable Sources: Scientists must be able to find, access, and utilize high-quality resources like journal articles, databases, and textbooks. Libraries and institutional subscriptions play a vital role in providing access to such materials. Critical Evaluation: Beyond finding information, researchers need to evaluate its relevance, reliability, and limitations. For example, distinguishing between primary research, review articles, and predatory journals is essential. Effective Searching: Developing advanced search skills, such as using databases, Boolean operators, and keywords, helps researchers find the most relevant information without missing critical studies. Citation and Credibility: Properly citing sources ensures academic integrity and acknowledges prior work, contributing to the collective knowledge in the field. Applications in Science and Careers: Research and Innovation: From understanding nitrogen’s impact on ecosystems to studying wildfire effects on water quality, every discovery builds on prior studies. Policy Development: Information literacy aids in creating evidence-based policies, such as strategies for improving public health or environmental conservation. Professional Growth: Mastery of these skills helps professionals stay competitive, make informed decisions, and contribute meaningfully to their fields. 5.3.1.2 Takeaways Information is a System: Knowledge progresses because discoveries are documented, made findable through databases, and accessible through libraries. You Are Integral: Your ability to find, access, and synthesize information directly impacts your effectiveness as a scientist. Practical Benefits: From avoiding misinformation to excelling in academic and professional projects, information literacy underpins success. By mastering these skills, you’ll not only thrive in your academic and career pursuits but also contribute to advancing science in meaningful ways. 5.3.2 Databases For this project, you will be selecting an article database accessed through the Cline Library to conduct your search (not google scholar, and not the quick search on the Cline library webpage). Article databases allow efficient and reproducible searches for journal articles, conference papers, and more. Google Scholar is useful for quick searches but lacks advanced search features and curation. You may use google scholar to find pdfs identified during your search. Examples of article databases by discipline include: - Biology: BIOSIS, Web of Science, Scopus - Medicine: PubMed - Engineering: IEEE Xplore - Psychology: PsycINFO 5.3.3 Search terms Once you have select a database to search, you must develop search terms. Three-step process for building search terms: Select essential keywords: Focus on the fewest, most critical terms that represent the topic. Gather synonyms: Expand the search with alternative terms to cover variations in language or phrasing. Use Boolean searches: Combine keywords and synonyms with operators like AND, OR, and NOT to refine and broaden searches effectively. Make decisions about database parameters. Each database should like you make the following decisions about how you search the database: Field-specific searching: Target keywords in specific parts of records (e.g., titles, abstracts). Sorting options: Organize results by relevance, citation count, or publication date. Filters: Narrow results by language, publication type, date, or population group (e.g., human studies in PubMed). Specialized search techniques: Quotation marks: For exact phrases (e.g., “Grand Canyon”). Asterisks: Capture word variations (e.g., comput* for compute, computing, computer). Filters in databases: Use discipline-specific filters to refine searches further (e.g., randomized controlled trials in PubMed). For other projects (not necessary for this project), if you would like to identify additional publications, you may choose to: Use citation chaining: Examine references cited in a paper or articles citing it. Identify related articles: Use tools like Google Scholar’s “Related Articles” to find similar studies. Employ author searches: Look for additional works by the same author(s) to explore their contributions further. Remember that you can always seek librarian support, which can significantly save time and improve search quality. When you write your methods, you will need to explicitly detail the terms you searched, including Boolean operators, synonyms, asterisk, and quotes. If you do not include this information, you will not receive full points, so please document your search carefully. 5.4 Procedure For this project, you will conduct a search, refine your question based on search results, and export a RIS file, which you will upload to a citation manager. Here is the step-by-step process to complete this activity: Select a database: Scopus, Web of Science Using the methods described above (Boolean operators, etc), search the database. Refine your search: You are aiming to review 20 - 100 papers. If your search is too broad, you will return too many papers. In order to reduce this number, try adding additional criteria, such as: Add a place. i.e., Colorado Plateau, Southwest, Arizona Add a global change component. i.e. How are bird migrations expected to shift as a function of climate change? Add an interaction. i.e., How are Saguaro cacti affected by mycorrhizae? Add a time. i.e., What threats to shark populations have emerged within the last 10 years? Once you have an appropriate number of citations, export the RIS file to upload later into your citation manager, as well as an excel file of your literature. Pro-tip: Upload your citations, as a google sheet so that each member can review papers. 5.5 Deliverables Please turn in the worksheet.

Coding information from manuscripts allows you to identify patterns, themes, and knowledge gaps while ensuring transparency and replicability in your review process. Coding involves creating a structured datasheet where each source is represented by a row, and the columns correspond to specific themes or factors of interest. This approach not only helps organize your findings but also serves as a foundation for your methods section, where you detail the process of analyzing your sources. Additionally, the themes identified in your coding table can inform the structure of your discussion, providing clear headings and subheadings. 7.1 Why Code Information? Structure and Organization: Coding ensures you capture key elements from every source and organize them systematically. Synthesis: Identifying recurring themes or factors across studies allows you to draw meaningful conclusions. Transparency: Including a coding table in your methods section provides a clear record of your process. Discussion Framework: Themes in the table can guide the structure of your discussion, helping readers follow your narrative. 7.2 How to Create a Coding Datasheet In the previous weeks of class, you have developed a research question, conducted a literature search, and identified literature to review. During your literature search process, you should have downloaded both the RIS file to enter into your citation manager AND an excel file that has your citations listed. This citation spreadsheet will become the basis of your coding table. 7.2.1 Design Your Coding Table Create a spreadsheet or table with the following features: Rows: Each row represents a single source or citation. Columns: Each column corresponds to a theme, factor, or piece of information you are extracting from the study (e.g., climate, disease dynamics, disturbance proximity, methods used, study location). For ease, modify the excel file that you downloaded. Much of the information from the file can be deleted for ease of review, but retain: the citation, date of publication, and location of publication, or any other information that you would like to capture to describe the state of literature related to your topic. Developing themes in a systematic literature review involves identifying patterns, concepts, and recurring ideas across multiple studies to synthesize findings meaningfully. The process begins by reading and coding the articles, focusing on key aspects such as research questions, methodologies, findings, and limitations. As you review the data, group similar ideas into preliminary categories. For instance, studies on ecological restoration might reveal themes like “restoration techniques,” “biodiversity outcomes,” or “climate adaptation.” Iteratively refine these categories as you read more, ensuring they accurately reflect the breadth and nuances of the literature. Use tools like spreadsheets, qualitative coding software, or conceptual mapping to organize and visualize these themes. Lastly, critically analyze the themes to identify gaps, contradictions, or emerging trends, which can guide your synthesis and highlight areas for future research. The goal is to develop themes that capture the essence of the body of work while remaining flexible enough to adapt to new insights as the review progresses. 7.2.2 Build your coding table Upload your file to a document sharing platform, like google sheets. Devise a plan for how to divide the review of these articles, and the information that each group member needs to add (date, location, note themes). 7.2.3 Analyze and Synthesize Once you have populated your table, you can use it to: Identify patterns and gaps in the data. Use the columns as a guide to structure your discussion sections - these columns will become the header of your discussion section. Highlight how your findings address your research question. 7.2.4 Deliverables Please turn in a screen shot of your coding table structure, and a brief description of the how you plan to review your literature, including how you will divide up the work among classmates and a timeline for completing the review. 7.2.5 Document your process How you will include in your final project: Methods Section: Describe how you identified and coded the sources. Detail the search terms and databases used. Explain how you decided on the themes for your coding table. Discussion Section: Use the themes identified in your coding table as subheadings. Synthesize findings across studies to address your research question. By following this approach, your literature review will be well-organized, thorough, and clearly linked to your research objectives.

Example: “Abstracts were rejected if they did not include geographic or temporal data on forest fires.” Identify Themes (for Systematic Reviews or Coding Studies): If you’re conducting a systematic review: - Read abstracts and categorize articles based on their relevance to research themes. - Record each decision and theme in a coding table. - Example: Themes like “climate resilience” or “fire recovery.” Use Visuals for Clarity: Tables, flowcharts, or diagrams can enhance understanding of complex methodologies. Example: A decision flowchart showing the article selection process for a literature review. Be Precise and Use Standard Terminology Avoid ambiguous language. Use clear, concise sentences with technical terms where necessary. Example: Instead of “a small number of samples,” specify “10 soil samples were collected.” Structure Your Section Logically Break it into subsections with headings for clarity: Data Collection Classification Analysis Key Tips: - Keep It Chronological: Describe the steps in the order they occurred. - Justify Your Choices: Explain why you chose specific methods over alternatives. - Be Transparent About Limitations: Acknowledge challenges in your methodology. 8.3 Example Opening of a Methods Section “Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using the terms”forest fires” AND “water quality” for studies published between 2010 and 2024. Abstracts were screened for relevance, and articles were included if they contained quantitative data on nitrogen runoff. Studies were excluded if they were not peer-reviewed or lacked geographic data. Data were coded for themes including ‘fire severity,’ ‘nitrogen leaching,’ and ‘stream health.’ Statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.3 using the lme4 package.” 8.4 Deliverables Turn in a draft of your methods section.

However, it is crucial to understand the ethical boundaries of using AI in their projects to ensure academic integrity and personal learning growth. 9.1 Acceptable Uses of AI Editing and Proofreading: You may use AI to check grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. AI can help refine writing by suggesting more concise or clearer ways to express ideas. Important: When editing and proofreading, you must include prompts that ask AI not to simply generate new text for you. See below. Brainstorming: You can use AI for brainstorming topics or approaches for their projects. For instance, if you are still struggling to identify a topic for your research paper, you can work with AI to obtain alternative perspectives or to explore potential areas of inquiry. Clarifying Concepts: AI can be used as a supplemental tool to explain scientific concepts or terms that you may not fully understand. When reviewing research articles for this class, you can ask AI to rephrase or simplify explanations found in research articles or class materials. Organizing Research: AI tools can assist with creating summaries of articles, identifying key points, or organizing thoughts into structured outlines. Code Assistance: For projects requiring programming, AI may help troubleshoot errors, explain coding concepts, or suggest improvements in scripts or algorithms. 9.2 Unacceptable Uses of AI Writing Original Content: You must write your own reports, essays, or project descriptions. AI-generated text should not substitute for original work. Using AI to create entire paragraphs or sections is considered academic dishonesty unless explicitly allowed by the instructor. Bypassing the Learning Process: Students should not use AI to generate answers to assignments, especially when the purpose is to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Plagiarism: Copying and pasting AI-generated text without proper citation, even if AI contributed minimally, is considered plagiarism. Fabricating Data or Results: AI must not be used to create fake data, results, or analyses that misrepresent actual findings. 9.3 Guidelines for Ethical Use When using AI at the University level, please be sure to remember these key guidelines for ethical AI use: Transparency: If you use AI tools for editing, organizing, or brainstorming, you must disclose this in your project documentation or acknowledgments. Instructor Approval: When in doubt, you should consult with the instructor about whether a specific use of AI is permissible for a given assignment. Cite AI Contributions: If you use AI for brainstorming or editing, you should acknowledge its role (e.g., “This text was reviewed and refined with the assistance of AI-based proofreading tools”). Focus on Learning: Use AI as a learning tool rather than a shortcut, ensuring that you fully understand the material and can demonstrate your knowledge independently. Critical Evaluation: Any content or suggestion from AI should be critically evaluated by the student for accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness to their work. 9.4 Assignment In this assignment, you will use AI to support the editing of your manuscript in an ethical manner - as a tool to help you learn to revise written work. Do NOT use this tool to write your manuscript - it is very easy to identify when students use AI for writing AND I will be using software to test for the use of AI. Using AI to draft text, will result in a 0 for the assignment. 9.4.1 Download and install ChatGPT or use a web browser Access ChatGPT on a Web Browser No Installation Required! The free version of ChatGPT does not require downloading or installation: Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Visit ChatGPT’s website. Log in using an existing account, or sign up for free using an email address, Google account, or Microsoft account. Use ChatGPT on Mobile Mobile-Friendly Website: Simply visit chat.openai.com on your mobile browser and log in. Mobile Apps (Optional): OpenAI offers official apps for ChatGPT on iOS and Android devices. Here’s how to download them: iPhone/iPad: Open the App Store. Search for “ChatGPT” by OpenAI. Tap Download and install the app. Android Devices: Open the Google Play Store. Search for “ChatGPT” by OpenAI. Tap Install to download the app. 9.4.2 Use ChatGPT to revise your methods section Last time, you drafted your methods section. Today, let’s use ChatGPT to work through the editing process. Enter your methods into ChatGPT and try the following prompts. Take notes on the suggested revisions. Then, make the suggested edits. Please be sure to work in tracked changes (word) or suggestions (google). Prompts to use with ChatGPT on the methods section: Prompt: “Please review this section for clarity and structure. Identify areas where the arguments could be better organized or clarified, but don’t rewrite the content.” Prompt: “Point out grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or sentence structure issues in this paragraph. Suggest why these might be problematic and how I might fix them.” Prompt: “Does this essay maintain an academic tone throughout? Are there areas where the tone is too informal or inconsistent? Provide suggestions for improvement.” Potential prompts to use for other sections: Prompt: “Does my paragragh statement clearly present the main argument? Are the supporting arguments logically connected to the topic? Suggest improvements but don’t provide a rewrite.” Prompt: “Are my citations properly integrated and do they effectively support my arguments? If not, suggest where I could add more evidence or improve the integration.” Prompt: “Based on this manuscript, what questions might a reader still have about my argument or evidence? Suggest where I might clarify or expand my ideas.” Prompt: “What are the main strengths and weaknesses of this manuscript? Provide constructive feedback that I can use to improve, but don’t make changes to the text.” 9.4.2.1 Take notes on edits Take notes on ChatGPT’s suggestions and decide which to implement and how. 9.4.2.2 Create edtis Based on ChatGPT’s feedback, make edits to your paper using tracked changes. 9.4.3 Write an AI statement for your Acknowledgements In your acknowledgements, you have the opportunity to thank anyone who has helped or contributed to the completion of your project. For this project, for example, you could thank Mary DeJong for teaching you about the literature review process. In a traditional paper, this is also where you declare funding sources. For your work in this class, you may choose to use AI according to the guidelines described above, but you must give credit for this support! In addition to your edits, please write a ‘Declaration of AI Use’ statement. Here is an example statement that you can use as a model for your declaration: This project acknowledges the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools during its development as follows: 1) Brainstorming and Ideation: AI-assisted tools, including ChatGPT, were used for brainstorming ideas and generating outlines. All content generated was critically reviewed and revised by the author(s) to align with the project’s objectives and requirements. 2) Proofreading and Editing: AI-based tools, such as ChatGPT, were used to review grammar, style, and clarity. Final edits were made by the author(s) to ensure the originality and accuracy of the work. 9.5 Key guidelines for using AI in class Please remember that AI use during college should be used as a tool to support the learning process. The goal of education is to learn, not to produce perfect products. Assignments like this are meant to train you with specific skills that you can use in the future. Using AI to help your learning is awesome, but please use this tool responsibly and ethically. Take note of ChatGPT’s suggestions and decide which to implement and how. You may not always agree with suggestion from AI tools - that’s great - you are developing your own writing style and philosophy of writing. Remember to always double-check AI suggestions, especially for academic writing or technical subjects. From experience, AI often generates inaccurate or vague statements regarding scientific content. 9.6 Deliverables Please turn in a document with brief notes about the edits that need to be made to your methods, your edited methods (with tracked changes), and a statement about how you used AI in your work.

The goal is to communicate the outcomes of your research in a way that is both logical and visually effective. 10.1 Key Elements of a Results Section Report Summary Data: Indicate how many studies your search returned. Specify how many studies were excluded and the final number of studies reviewed. Highlight Themes: Identify and report the number of themes your research revealed. Figures and Visuals: Include clear and relevant figures to illustrate your findings. Examples: A timeline showing the number of studies published over time. A pie chart displaying the proportion of studies addressing different themes. A map or chart showing regional classifications of papers, if applicable. Keep it Brief: The results section should focus solely on presenting data and findings. Reserve explanations or interpretations for the discussion section. 10.2 Tips for Structuring the Results Section This methods section will be brief, but for future assignments consider. - Organizing results under subheadings that align with your research questions or thematic categories. Use Tables and Figures Effectively: Ensure tables and figures are self-explanatory with clear captions. Refer to figures and tables directly in the text to guide readers. Focus on the Facts: Avoid discussing the implications or significance of your findings here. This is strictly for presenting what you found. 10.3 Example Structure “Our systematic review retrieved 150 studies, of which 50 were excluded after screening, resulting in a final dataset of 100 studies. These studies were grouped into three themes: environmental impacts, policy responses, and community engagement. Environmental impacts were addressed in 40% of the studies, policy responses in 35%, and community engagement in 25%. Regional analysis indicated the majority of studies were conducted in North America and Europe. The majority of references were generated in the United States (Fig. 1)” By following these steps, you can craft a results section that effectively communicates your findings while setting the stage for a compelling discussion section. 10.4 Deliverables A draft of your written results (we will work on figures next time).

This is the general structure of a scientific paper: Introduction (Broad → Specific): Begin with a broad context to engage your audience and highlight the relevance of your work. Narrow the focus to your specific research topic. Define the knowledge gap your study addresses. End with a clear research question or hypothesis. Methods (Specific): Detail the experimental setup, data collection, and analytical techniques. Ensure transparency and reproducibility. Results (Specific): Present your findings with supporting data (e.g., figures, tables). Avoid interpretation in this section—focus on the “what.” Discussion and Conclusions (Specific → Broad): Interpret the results and link them to the broader context. Discuss implications, limitations, and future research directions. 12.2 Extra parts: Title, Abstract, Acknowledgements, and Literature Cited Title: Make the title concise and informative to attract the right audience. Include this on your title page, along with the names of the manuscript’s authors. Abstract: Summarize the manuscript’s key points: You should plan on including 1 - 2 sentences per section (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion/Conclusions) that briefly describes the main points of that section. The abstract is often created last. Please put this on the title page, below the title, and authors’ names. Acknowledgements: Thank any one that contributed to the paper - be sure to credit AI or other resources that you used to complete your manuscript. Place this at the end of your manuscript after figures and tables, but before the literature cited. Literature Cited: Use your citation manager to create your bibliography. Be sure to edit citations for errors within Zotero. 12.3 Writing an Effective Introduction The introduction is crucial for setting the stage and drawing readers into your manuscript. It should seamlessly transition from broad background information to the specific objectives of your study. Follow these steps: Set the Stage: Explain why the research topic is important. Use current data, trends, or challenges to provide context. Example: “Global climate change has accelerated shifts in species distributions, raising critical questions about ecosystem resilience and biodiversity management.” Introduce Concepts: Define key terms and introduce foundational concepts relevant to your study. Include citations from the literature to establish credibility. Example: “Ecological resilience refers to an ecosystem’s capacity to absorb disturbances while maintaining essential functions.” Identify the Knowledge Gap: Highlight what is currently known and what remains unclear or unanswered. Emphasize how your study addresses this gap. Example: “Despite advances in understanding resilience mechanisms, little is known about how species interactions influence recovery trajectories in post-fire environments.” End with the Research Question or Objective: Clearly state what your study aims to achieve or investigate. This statement should naturally flow from the preceding context. Example: “This study examines the role of keystone species in post-fire ecological recovery to provide insights into effective conservation strategies.” Writing Style for Introductions: As with all scientific writing, be sure that it is: Concise and Logical: Avoid unnecessary details—focus on clarity and relevance. Engaging: Use active voice and compelling statements to maintain interest. Well-Cited: Use references to support claims and establish credibility. 12.4 Deliverables Create the overall structure of your manuscript, including your title page.

Replace multi-word phrases with simpler equivalents (e.g., “due to the fact that” → “because”). Use precise scientific language when describing concepts or findings. Clarity and Simplicity: Prefer straightforward words over complex ones (e.g., “used” instead of “utilized”). Simplify sentences by reducing passive voice and ensuring the subject performs the action (active voice preferred). Cohesion and Coherence: Ensure logical transitions between sentences and ideas (cohesion). Maintain focus on the main topic within each paragraph, with a clear opening and closing sentence (coherence). Use ‘thought-chaining,’ where the last idea in one sentence leads to the first idea in the next. Effective Sentence Structure: Keep subjects close to their verbs to avoid reader confusion. Use simple subjects, splitting complex ones into multiple sentences if needed. Emphasizing Important Information: Begin sentences with familiar (old) information and place new information at the end. Highlight key points in the first and last sentences of each paragraph. Adjective and Adverb Usage: Use adjectives and adverbs sparingly to avoid unnecessary embellishments. Remove overused modifiers like “very” and “extremely” unless essential. Citing and Avoiding Plagiarism: Always rephrase ideas in your own words. Properly attribute all sources; avoid quoting directly unless absolutely necessary. 15.2 Revision Techniques Search and replace wordy phrases or overly complex language. Simplify subjects and rephrase sentences to bring clarity. Review first and last sentences of paragraphs to ensure they match and reinforce the main idea.
