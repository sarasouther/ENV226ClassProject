### Overview of presentation platforms

Before diving into how to craft a compelling scientific presentation, it’s important to choose the right platform. Popular platforms include:

- PowerPoint: A versatile and widely used tool for creating professional presentations with extensive customization options.
- Canva: A user-friendly, web-based platform with pre-designed templates and visually appealing graphics.
- Google Slides: A collaborative platform great for team projects and real-time edits, with basic design features.
- Prezi: For non-linear presentations that emphasize visual storytelling and dynamic motion paths.
- Keynote: Exclusive to Apple devices, offering clean, professional design options.

### Steps to assemble a scientific presentation

#### Plan Your Content

-	Define Your Objective: Know the purpose of your presentation—inform, persuade, or engage your audience.
- Identify Key Points: Focus on 3-5 main points to ensure clarity and retention.
- Understand Your Audience: Tailor content to the background knowledge and interests of your audience (e.g., peers, professors, or a general audience).

#### Structure Your Presentation

- **Title Slide**:
  - Title of the presentation.
	- Your name, affiliation, and date.
- **Introduction**:
	- Clearly state your research question or topic.
	- Provide brief context or background information.
	- Mention the objectives of your study or talk.
- **Methods**:
	- Explain the methodology concisely.
	- Use diagrams or flowcharts to simplify complex processes.
- **Results**:
	- Highlight key findings with graphs, charts, or visuals.
	- Avoid overloading slides with data—focus on takeaways.
- **Discussion**:
	- Interpret your findings in the context of existing knowledge.
	- Emphasize the significance and implications of your results.
- **Conclusion**:
	- Summarize your key points.
	- Suggest future directions or practical applications.
- **Acknowledgments**:
	- Credit collaborators, funding sources, and supporting institutions.
	- References (if applicable):
	- Cite critical sources used in your presentation.

#### Design Your Slides

- **Use Visuals**:

	- Prioritize graphs, charts, and images over text.
	- Ensure visuals are high-resolution and labeled clearly.
	
- **Keep It Simple**:

	- Follow the “6x6 rule”: No more than 6 words per bullet and 6 bullets per slide.
	- Use plenty of white space for readability.
	- Maintain Consistency:
	- Choose a professional theme and stick to a color palette.
	- Use consistent font types and sizes (e.g., 28-point for headings, 24-point for body text).
	- Engage With Animations Sparingly:
	- Use animations only to emphasize key points or reveal complex data step-by-step.

#### Practice Clear Communication

- **Rehearse Your Delivery**:

	- Practice multiple times to refine timing and fluency.
	- Record yourself to identify areas for improvement.

- **Engage With the Audience**:

	- Maintain eye contact, use natural gestures, and vary your tone.
	- Prepare for questions by anticipating potential queries related to your work.

#### Tips for an Effective Presentation

For particular good presentations, here are a few tips:

1.	Start Strong: Open with an interesting fact, a question, or a brief anecdote to grab attention.
2.	Stay On Time: Stick to the allocated time and pace yourself.
3.	Make Data Memorable: Use color and contrast in graphs to emphasize key findings.
4.	End With Impact: Leave the audience with a clear take-home message.
